# St-Augustine-CHS
The iOS Version of the St Augustine CHS Official App

About Us
We started developing this app because we wanted to increase school spirit within the student body and promote the technological aspect of our school community. Also, we never knew whether it is a day 1 or a day 2 and wanted to find a solution to this common confusion within our school. The team started out knowing close to nothing about app development, so the process of building this app has been a journey for all of us. From marketing and design to backend server and database management , we have gained several new skills and collaborated with a number of people in order to bring this app to life.
